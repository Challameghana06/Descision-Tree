# 🌳 Decision Tree Implementation in Python

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** demonstrating the implementation of **Decision Tree algorithms** for both classification and regression tasks. It walks through key concepts like information gain, entropy, and Gini impurity, along with visualizations that explain how decision trees split data.

## 📘 Contents
- Introduction to Decision Trees  
- Dataset Overview and Preprocessing  
- Splitting Criteria: Entropy and Gini Index  
- Building a Decision Tree Classifier  
- Visualizing the Decision Tree  
- Model Evaluation and Accuracy Metrics  
- Overfitting and Pruning Techniques  
- Regression Tree Implementation (if included)
